# Standalone usage

Using Traust skills locally, one at a time, outside the automated campaign workflow. For the end-to-end campaign see [campaign-workflow.md](campaign-workflow.md); for the pipeline overview see the [README](../README.md#how-to-use-this-workflow-engine).

"Standalone" mode refers to using any of these skills independently outside of an automated workflow.

## Standalone Skills

These skills work against any codebase or report files you supply _outside of the full workflow_ with minimal coaxing. The expected inputs are always listed in the "Inputs" column, but if you want all of the options, see [docs/skills.md](skills.md).

Skills marked with Environment or Infrastructure requirements need access to services your organisation runs; the workflow engine names the kind of service, your deployment supplies the instance. Typical setup:
* **Employee directory** - the optional `LEDGER_DIRECTORY_COMMAND` cross-check; SSO/VPN as your directory requires
* **Jira** - MCP or CLI with access to target projects required
* **Ephemeral OCP Cluster** - any short-lived OCP cluster; if your organization runs an on-demand cluster service, that is the simplest route
* **Playwright** - the playwright MCP server and package installed and configured for web-driving support
* **Google Workspace** - the gws CLI, these skills use the Google Workspace API to modify Google Docs or Drive

Skills with no infrastructure requirement need only the workflow engine and a target codebase.

| `create-fuzzing` | ⑥ | Offline fuzz harnesses (Go-native default, plus Python/atheris, JS-TS/Jazzer.js, Rust/cargo-fuzz, Java/jazzer templates) for parser/decoder/templater entry points flagged in audit reports; explicitly offline — no cluster, cloud, or network | Any audit report + target checkout | — | opus-class (`fuzz-author` floor) |
| `patch` | ⑦ | Inert candidate-fix diffs per confirmed triage finding (patch subagent + independent reviewer); never applies, never writes outside `./PATCHES/` | A `TRIAGE.json`, audit report, or `*-vuln-findings.json` | — | mythos-class |

| `impact-analysis` | — | Per-repo CVE affectedness across the portfolio graph: blast radius query, L4 package-import refinement, language-specific deep scan (Go's govulncheck + ELF reachability is the strongest tier; other ecosystems get manifest-level analysis); feeds `/triage` Phase 2f, `/verify-remediation --impact-filter`, and the `/dependency-watch` filing leg | A CVE ID + portfolio-graph.db | — | opus-class |
