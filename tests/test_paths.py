"""Skill enumeration — one helper, two layouts.

`skill_dirs()` exists so the stage-directory move
(progress-tracker/plans/skill-usability-reorganization-plan.md 1.2) costs
one function instead of ten call sites. These tests hold both halves of
that claim: the live flat tree enumerates exactly as the old
`harnessing/*/SKILL.md` glob did, and a nested fixture enumerates too —
so the move is a no-op for every gate, provable before it happens.
