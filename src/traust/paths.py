    level below ``harnessing/``; the skill-usability reorganization
    (progress-tracker/plans/skill-usability-reorganization-plan.md 1.2)
    nests the 34 workflow skills one level deeper under a stage directory
    — ``harnessing/4-triage/triage/`` — while the other 24 stay at the
    root. So this walks two levels and takes whichever one carries the
    ``SKILL.md``, and the move costs this function nothing.

    Enumerate through here instead of globbing ``harnessing/*/SKILL.md``:
    ten call sites baked that depth in, which is the whole reason the move
    looked expensive. The walk stops at a skill boundary, so a ``SKILL.md``
    *inside* a skill — a cloned target repo, a template — is never counted
    as a skill of its own.

    ``repo`` is a harness checkout root, so a gate can pass its own and
    resolve against a test fixture tree; it defaults to this checkout.
    Order is by ``name``, not by path: names are unique (rule A6), so it is
    a total order, and gate output does not reshuffle when the stage
    directories land.
