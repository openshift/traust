"""Skill security-posture guard — catch a new or edited skill degrading
the harness's security posture, before it is committed.

Born from the 2026-07-24 pre-release self-audit
(progress-tracker/plans/harness-security-remediation-plan.md). The audit
found one repeating meta-pattern: the most privileged skills were the
least confined, and each unsafe construct (git transport injection,
token-in-argv, /tmp credential caches, unpinned installs) entered through
one skill while its siblings already carried the safe pattern. This
checker makes the safe patterns mechanical for every FUTURE skill; the
EXEMPTIONS map grandfathers today's known violators, each entry citing
the remediation-plan item that will remove it — the list must only ever
shrink.

Rules (S-series; A-series lives in check_skill_alignment.py):
  S1 confinement      A SKILL.md whose prose indicates privileged
                      capability (pushing, cluster mutation, running
                      target build/test, fetching URLs) must declare an
                      `allowed-tools` frontmatter allowlist.
                      (Audit findings D1/D2/D3.)
  S2 doctrine         A SKILL.md that reads untrusted target content or
                      report prose must carry the adversarial-content
                      doctrine (CWE-1427 / prompt-injection block).
                      (Audit finding D4.)
  S3 git-transport    A skill/harness script that runs a git network
                      command on a non-literal URL must, in the same
                      file, set GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL and show an
                      https-scheme gate. (Audit findings A1/A2/A3 —
                      the confirmed-RCE class.)
  S4 shell-exec       No `shell=True`, `os.system`, `os.popen`, or
                      `bash -lc` on variable text in skill scripts.
                      (Audit finding C2.)
  S5 token-argv       No `curl` with an inline Authorization header —
                      argv is ps-visible; use `--config -` on stdin.
                      (Audit finding E2.)
  S6 tmp-paths        No fixed world-writable `/tmp/<name>` literals for
                      state, credentials, or caches — predictable shared
                      paths are plantable/symlink-squattable.
                      (Audit findings B2/B4/E9.)
  S7 unpinned-install No runtime `pip install pkg` without `==`,
                      `npm install pkg` without `@version`,
                      `go install ...@latest`, or `curl | sh`.
                      (Audit findings E1/C3/E11.)
  S8 egress-grants    allowed-tools may not grant raw network egress
                      (`Bash(curl:*)`, `Bash(wget:*)`, `Bash(gh api:*)`)
                      — an exfiltration channel under injection; wrap
                      the needed fetch in a scoped script.
                      (Audit finding D7.)
  S9 repo-config      A skill/script that launches a headless agent
     isolation        (`claude -p/--print`, `crush run`, `opencode run`)
                      must, in the same file, carry the repo-config
                      isolation doctrine: agent cwd outside the
                      untrusted checkout, and repo-supplied agent config
                      (`.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, hooks) never loaded as
                      configuration — it is data under audit. Measured
                      incident 2026-07-26 (b-lite-p5): corpus repos
                      shipping their own `.claude` hooks killed — and
                      could have injected — headless scan workers.

  S10 target-build   A skill/script that executes an audited checkout's
      sandbox        own build machinery (make/mvn/gradle/go build/npm/
                     cargo in an execution context) must route it
                     through traust_engine._util.safe_exec — enforced command
                     validation with profile allowlists, git -c/network
                     hardening, and shell-free pipeline execution.
                     (sandbox-adoption WS1,
                     the sandbox-adoption plan (internal);
                     pattern source: balor-fianna SafeBash.)
