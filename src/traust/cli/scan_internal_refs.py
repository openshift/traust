"""Pre-publication scrub: organization-internal references in an export candidate.

Open-sourcing turns every tracked file into a public artifact. This is the
Phase-3 gate of the open-source upstream plan — a repeatable check rather
than a one-off grep, so it can run on the export tree before every upstream
release, not just once.

Universal rules (credential shapes, RFC1918, cloud identifiers) are compiled
in. The rules that name YOUR hosts, tools, trackers and products come from
$TRAUST_CONFIG_HOME/internal-vocabulary.yaml — see --vocabulary. That split is not a
convenience: a scanner shipping a list of an organization's internal tool
names has published that list.

IT ROUTES ATTENTION, NEVER CONCLUDES. A hit is a thing to look at, not a
verdict: a security-alias address is published on purpose, a documentation
endpoint is public, and a tracker key inside a CHANGELOG entry may be
perfectly fine to ship. Severity orders the review queue; a human decides
what leaves.

Tiers
  block    credentials and internal-only network identity. Nothing in this
           tier should ever reach a public repo.
  review   internal process/tooling vocabulary and person identifiers.
           Usually fine in an internal doc, usually wrong in a public one.
  note     public surface and product vocabulary. Recorded so a reviewer can
           confirm the export reads as a generic tool rather than one
           organization's campaign artifact.

Scans only files git tracks: untracked scratch, caches and build output
are not part of an export, and including them buries the real signal.

Usage:
    python3 -m traust.cli.scan_internal_refs [REPO ...]
        [--tier block|review|note] [--json OUT] [--max-per-rule N]
        [--fail-on block|review]
Exit 0 when nothing at or above --fail-on is found, 1 otherwise.
