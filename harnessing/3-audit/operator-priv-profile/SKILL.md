name: operator-priv-profile
description: Use when the user asks whether an operator runs with least privilege, what SCCs/securityContext/namespaces/roles an operator uses or requires, or for a fleet least-privilege inventory of OpenShift core and optional operators. Builds a deterministic per-operator privilege profile from manifests/CSVs (tier 1 — SCC requests, per-container securityContext, namespaces/install modes, complete RBAC enumeration), diffs shipped RBAC against the code's +kubebuilder:rbac markers (tier 2 — surplus grants = least-priv gap), and ships a gated runtime capture for the actually-assigned SCC and effective SA permissions (tier 3, executed only with explicit cluster authorization).

Answers "does this operator run with the least privileges it requires?"
in three fidelity tiers. The findings tree alone cannot answer this — it
records privilege *violations*, not inventories; this skill builds the
*has vs. needs* picture.

| Tier | Question | Source | Tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | What does the operator **ask for**? | manifests + CSV in the repo | `build_priv_profile.py` |
| 2 | What does it **declare it needs**? | `+kubebuilder:rbac:` markers vs shipped roles | same (diff section) |
| 3 | What does it **actually run with**? | live cluster (pod `openshift.io/scc`, `oc auth can-i --list`) | `capture_runtime_privileges.py` |

## Tier 1+2 — static profile

```bash
python harnessing/3-audit/operator-priv-profile/scripts/build_priv_profile.py \
    --repo-url <url> [--ref <ref>] --name <repo-name> \
    --out-dir analysis-results/findings/<product>/<repo>/
```

Emits `<repo>-priv-profile.{json,md}` next to the repo's audit report:

- **SCC requests** — RBAC `use` verbs on `securitycontextconstraints`
  (with `resourceNames`) plus any shipped SCC objects. *No request
  recorded ⇒ OpenShift assigns `restricted-v2` by default* — say that,
  never imply "unknown".
- **securityContext** — pod- and container-level for every workload
  (Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet + CSV-embedded deployments), plus
  host{Network,PID,IPC} and hostPath volumes.
- **Namespaces / install modes** — Namespace objects, workload
  namespaces, CSV `installModes`, OperatorGroup targetNamespaces.
- **Complete RBAC enumeration** — every Role/ClusterRole/CSV-permission
  rule with scope + source, and risk flags (wildcards, secrets access,
  RBAC write, escalate/bind/impersonate, pods/exec, nodes).
- **Tier-2 diff** — shipped rules with no `+kubebuilder:rbac` marker
  backing them (`shipped_not_declared`) are the least-privilege surplus
  candidates. Repos without markers get an honest "not derivable
  statically" note — do NOT infer need from silence.

Fleet rollup (after profiling a set):

```bash
python harnessing/3-audit/operator-priv-profile/scripts/build_priv_profile.py \
    --rollup 'analysis-results/findings/*/*/*-priv-profile.json' \
    --rollup-out progress-tracker/metrics/dashboards/operator-least-priv/
```

Emits four artifacts, one row per operator with one column per assessment
question (SCCs requested / securityContext posture / namespaces + install
modes / RBAC): `priv-profile-rollup.md` (paste-into-doc table),
`priv-profile-rollup.json` (full rows), `priv-profile-rollup.csv`
(spreadsheet export), and `priv-profile-dashboard.html` (KPI tiles + top-60
table). Exclude catalog aggregation trees (certified-operators,
community-operators, marketplace) from profiling — a catalog's thousands of
third-party bundles would read as one giant "operator" and distort the
ranking.

## Tier 3 — runtime capture (gated; execute only when scheduled)

```bash
python harnessing/3-audit/operator-priv-profile/scripts/capture_runtime_privileges.py \
    --namespace <ns> --name <repo-name> \
    --out-dir analysis-results/findings/<product>/<repo>/ \
    --i-am-authorized [--kubeconfig <path>]
```

Read-only (`get`/`auth can-i` only, audit trail embedded). **Fail-closed:
refuses without `--i-am-authorized`**, which asserts the cluster is
within the campaign's authorized scope (same discipline as
validate-findings). Captures per pod: the ACTUALLY-ASSIGNED SCC
annotation, container securityContexts as admitted, the namespace PSA
labels, and each ServiceAccount's effective permission list. The
deploy-operator / validate-operator-live lanes are the natural place to
run this right after install.

## Interpretation rules

1. **Requested ≠ assigned.** Tier 1 shows intent; only tier 3 shows the
   SCC actually applied. Keep the tiers labeled in every artifact.
2. **Surplus needs verification before filing.** `shipped_not_declared`
   rules may be exercised by non-kubebuilder code paths (plain client-go,
   helpers); confirm with a call-site search before calling it excess.
   Confirmed surplus feeds `/file-security-defect` or the audit report as
   an authorization finding.
3. **Helm/Go-templated manifests are skipped** by the parser — a profile
   from a chart-heavy repo is partial; say so rather than presenting it
   as complete.
4. Profiles are inventory documents, not findings: place them beside the
   audit reports in `analysis-results`; only the rollup goes to
   `progress-tracker/metrics/dashboards/` (rollups-only discipline — the
   convention is documented for every skill in `docs/artifacts.md`).

## Integrations

- **`/secure-code-audit`** runs the profiler as a conditional pre-scan on
  manifest-bearing repos (records `priv-profile` in `deterministic_steps`)
  — every audit/re-audit refreshes the fleet's profiles.
- **`/secure-container-audit`** profiles extracted operator **bundle
  images** (`/manifests` tree; tier-2 n/a — no Go source in images).
- **`/isolation-review`** consumes existing profiles as
  privilege-dimension evidence (never re-derives RBAC by hand where a
  profile exists).

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Empty profile from an operator repo | manifests are helm-templated or generated at build time | note partial coverage; profile the bundle/CSV repo instead |
| `surplus` = n/a fleet-wide | non-kubebuilder codebase | tier 3 or manual call-site review is the needs-baseline |
| Runtime capture refuses to run | missing `--i-am-authorized` | intentional — verify cluster authorization first |
