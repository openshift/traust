# Threat-model file schema

Both `/threat-model interview` and `/threat-model bootstrap` write
this file to `<target-dir>/<repo>-threat-model.md` (naming rule in
`SKILL.md`; portfolio copies under `analysis-results/findings/` may be
branch-suffixed and carry the identical contract). `THREAT_MODEL.md` is
the legacy name — `lint_threat_model.py` and the register still accept
it, but the skill never writes it. The format is markdown so humans
can read and edit it, but the section headings, table columns, and enum values
below are a contract: keep the headings and column order exactly as shown so
downstream tooling can parse them with regex.

---

## Required sections, in order

```markdown
# Threat Model: <system name>

## 1. System context

## 2. Assets

## 3. Entry points & trust boundaries

## 4. Threats

## 5. Deprioritized

## 6. Open questions

## 7. Provenance

## 8. Recommended mitigations

## 9. Attack scenarios

## 10. Tenant boundaries
```

A consumer that only needs the threat table can regex for `^## 4\. Threats$`
and read until the next `^## `. Sections 8, 9, and 10 are optional and
additive: older threat models may omit them, and consumers must tolerate
their absence. Section 10 applies **only to multi-tenant services** —
single-tenant targets never carry it.

**Deterministic gate:** python3 -m traust.cli reporting lint enforces this contract
(sections, table columns, enums, the coverage invariant, ID stability,
provenance completeness, evidence-cell hygiene). A new emission is not
complete until it exits `Result: ALL PASSED`.

---

## Section contents

### 1. System context

Prose, in two parts:

1. **Executive summary first** (new emissions): open with 1-2 short
   paragraphs readable by a non-technical leader — what the system is, the
   top 2-3 threats in plain language, and the single most important action.
   No jargon: "an attacker could steal customer payment details through a
   flaw in the search feature", not "STRIDE-identified information
   disclosure via SQLi".
2. Then one to three paragraphs of technical context: what the system is,
   what it does, who uses it, where it runs. This is the answer to "what are
   we working on?".

Optionally end the section with a **threat actor landscape** subsection:

```markdown
### Threat actor landscape
```

2-4 personas from {`apt`, `organized_crime`, `malicious_insider`,
`negligent_insider`, `hacktivist`, `opportunistic`, `competitor`,
`supply_chain`}, each with **one sentence of system-specific motivation**
derived from the assets table ("this operator holds cluster-admin
credentials for fleet clusters → supply-chain and APT personas are
primary"). The persona layer is prose color for humans; the section 4
`actor` column (access position) remains the scoring input. Never replace
the `actor` enum with persona names.

### 2. Assets

Markdown table. One row per thing worth protecting.

| asset | description | sensitivity |
|---|---|---|

`sensitivity` ∈ {`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`}.

Two optional columns may be **appended** (data classification; new
emissions should populate them when the information is discoverable):

| asset | description | sensitivity | regulatory_scope | example_records |
|---|---|---|---|---|

- `regulatory_scope`: comma-separated regimes governing the asset (`GDPR`,
  `CCPA`, `HIPAA`, `PCI-DSS`, `SOX`, `export-control`, …) or `none`.
- `example_records`: concrete field or record names ("name, email,
  address"; "kubeconfig, pull-secret").

Consumers address columns by header, so appended columns are safe; never
insert columns between the original three. Beyond report quality, tenancy
and data-sensitivity context here feeds the same `tenancy_profile`
derivation the ledger emitter uses for hardening λ weights.

### 3. Entry points & trust boundaries

Markdown table. One row per place untrusted input enters the system or
privilege level changes.

| entry_point | description | trust_boundary | reachable_assets |
|---|---|---|---|

`trust_boundary` is free text naming the crossing (e.g. "untrusted file →
process memory", "unauth network → authenticated session").
`reachable_assets` is a comma-separated list of asset names from section 2.

### 4. Threats

Markdown table. **This is the threat model proper.** One row per
actor-wants-outcome pair, at the abstraction level where it survives a patch.

| id | threat | actor | surface | asset | impact | likelihood | status | controls | evidence | attack_refs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

The trailing `attack_refs` column is **default for new emissions** (harness
≥ 0.82.0 — the lint gate errors on a ten-column table whose provenance
carries a ≥ 0.82.0 harness version). Legacy ten-column models remain
valid; `update`/`review` passes must not renumber or reorder rows, and add
the column only when they emit a new file version anyway.

A second trailing column, `isolation_dimensions`, is **optional** (never
default) and appears only after `attack_refs`, only in models of
multi-tenant services that carry a section 10:

| id | threat | actor | surface | asset | impact | likelihood | status | controls | evidence | attack_refs | isolation_dimensions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- `id`: `T1`, `T2`, … Stable across edits; do not renumber when rows are
  removed. In `update`/`review` passes a removed threat's id is **retired,
  never reused**: the row moves to section 5 with the removal reason and
  date, and the next new threat takes the next never-used number.
- `threat`: One sentence, active voice, names the outcome. "Remote code
  execution via untrusted media parsing", not "buffer overflow in dr_wav".
  Rows produced by the optional LINDDUN privacy overlay carry a leading
  `linddun:` tag in this cell (e.g., "linddun: re-identification of tenants
  via correlated audit-log exports") so a reviewer can trace which pass
  produced them.
- `actor`: one or more of {`remote_unauth`, `remote_auth`,
  `adjacent_network`, `local_user`, `local_admin`, `supply_chain`,
  `insider`}, comma-separated when a threat is reachable from more than
  one position (e.g. `remote_auth, insider`). List the weakest-position
  actor first; scoring reads the first entry.
- `surface`: Which entry point(s) from section 3 this threat traverses.
- `asset`: Which asset(s) from section 2 this threat compromises.
- `impact` ∈ {`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`, `existential`}.
- `likelihood` ∈ {`very_rare`, `rare`, `possible`, `likely`,
  `almost_certain`}.
- `status` ∈ {`unmitigated`, `partially_mitigated`, `mitigated`,
  `risk_accepted`}.
- `controls`: Current mitigations, or `none`.
- `evidence`: CVE IDs, issue links, pentest finding IDs, or git commit
  hashes that **instantiate** this threat. May be empty. **Evidence raises
  likelihood; it is not the threat.**
- `attack_refs` (default column for new emissions; absent only in legacy
  models): comma-separated MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs (`T1611`,
  `T1552.007`) naming the adversary behavior the threat describes. **Bounded selection, not narrative**: IDs must exist and be
  non-revoked/non-deprecated in the harness's pinned ATT&CK table — check
  with `python3 traust/harnessing/attack-coverage/scripts/attack_refs.py
  --validate <ids>`; sub-technique preferred over parent when one fits;
  2 IDs is typical, more than 4 means the threat row is too broad — split
  it. Leave the cell empty rather than guessing: the `/attack-coverage`
  roll-up treats an explicit ID as *modeled* coverage, so a wrong ID
  pollutes the fleet heat-map. ATT&CK(R) content is (c) The MITRE
  Corporation, used with attribution.
- `isolation_dimensions` (optional trailing column; multi-tenant services
  with a section 10 only): comma-separated subset of the five
  isolation-hardening dimension keys — `privilege`, `encryption`,
  `authentication`, `connectivity`, `hygiene` (same vocabulary as
  `contracts/schemas/isolation-review.schema.json`) — tagging which dimension(s) the
  threat stresses. Empty cell valid: not every threat in a multi-tenant
  model is an isolation threat. The `/threat-register` roll-up reads the
  tags to rank the fleet's weakest tenant boundaries.

Sort the table by (impact, likelihood) descending so the top rows are the
priorities.

### 5. Deprioritized

Markdown table. Threats considered and explicitly parked.

| threat | reason |
|---|---|

Common reasons: out of scope, actor not in threat model, asset not present,
risk accepted by owner.

### 6. Open questions

Bullet list. Things the mode could not determine. For `bootstrap` these are
questions for a human owner; for `interview` these are claims the owner made
that were not verifiable in code.

### 7. Provenance

```markdown
- mode: interview | bootstrap | bootstrap-then-interview
- date: YYYY-MM-DD
- target: <path or repo url @ commit>
- inputs: <design doc path | --vulns path | --context paths | "none">
- owner: <name, for interview> | <unset, for bootstrap>
- harness_version: <semver>-<short sha>
```

`harness_version` is required for new emissions and marks the schema/
taxonomy epoch, exactly like `metadata.harness_version` in audit reports
and `triage_context.harness_version` in triage artifacts — read the semver
from the harness `VERSION` file and append the short git SHA. Legacy
artifacts predate it; the linter warns rather than errors on its absence.

When an `update` or `review --apply` pass modifies the file, append an
**update history** table inside this section (additive; `mode` keeps the
original value):

```markdown
### Update history

| date | changes | reason |
|---|---|---|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Retired T3, added T12, T5 likelihood likely→possible | review vs HEAD abc1234 |
```

### 8. Recommended mitigations

Optional, additive: older threat-model files may omit this section, and
consumers must tolerate its absence. Each row is **one class-level control**,
not a per-finding patch: a mitigation that closes or materially shrinks an
entire threat cluster regardless of which instance is found next.

```markdown
| mitigation | threat_ids | closes_class | effort |
|---|---|---|---|
```

- `mitigation`: imperative, one line (e.g., "sandbox the decoder process",
  "parameterized queries everywhere", "drop pickle for json", "enable CSP
  default-src 'self'", "size-cap all length fields before allocation").
- `threat_ids`: comma-separated section 4 ids (e.g., `T1,T3`) this mitigation covers.
- `closes_class`: `yes` | `partial` | `no` (`no` = worthwhile
  defense-in-depth that does not close the class).
- `effort`: `XS` | `S` | `M` | `L`.

Cells containing a literal `|` (regex alternations, `\|\| true`) must
escape it as `\|` per GFM — an unescaped pipe fractures the row for every
table consumer, not just the linter.

### 9. Attack scenarios

Optional, additive: older files may omit it, and consumers must tolerate its
absence. **New emissions should include it** for the top 3-5 threats by
impact × likelihood. This is the narrative layer for humans — the tables
above remain the machine contract.

One subsection per scenario, heading anchored to the section 4 id:

```markdown
### T1 — <threat text from section 4>

<3-5 sentences, present tense, describing the attack as it unfolds: who the
attacker is (persona if a landscape subsection exists, otherwise the actor
position), the path taken (name the section 3 entry point), and the impact
in concrete terms — "reads every tenant's pull-secret", not "data breach".
Close with one sentence on why current controls don't stop it (or how far
they get).>
```

Writing bar: readable by a non-technical VP; no framework jargon, no CWE
numbers. `file:line` citations stay out of section 9 for the same reason
they stay out of `evidence` — narratives must survive a patch.
`/generate-team-report` lifts this section verbatim into team packages.

### 10. Tenant boundaries

Optional, additive — and **only for multi-tenant services** (a service where
distinct customers/tenants share running instances or data paths).
Single-tenant targets must omit it; older models may omit it regardless, and
consumers must tolerate its absence. One row per interface through which a
tenant drives input into the service or through which tenant data flows.
The vocabulary is deliberately shared with the `isolation-review` skill
(`contracts/schemas/isolation-review.schema.json`) so boundary rows and full
service-level isolation reviews line up. The lens is informed by **PEACH**,
Wiz Research's tenant-isolation methodology
([peach.wiz.io](https://peach.wiz.io)), applied **by reference only** —
cite it by name/URL; never copy or adapt its rubric text, tables, or
examples into a model (the python3 -m traust.cli check content-licenses fingerprint
gate fails the pre-push hook on re-imported adapted text; all wording here
is original to this repository).

```markdown
| boundary_id | interface | kind | exposure | complexity | privilege | encryption | authentication | connectivity | hygiene | threat_ids | isolation_review_ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
```

- `boundary_id`: `IF-1`, `IF-2`, … — stable, never renumbered or reused
  (same discipline as section 4 threat ids). When a full isolation review
  exists, keep ids aligned with its `interfaces[].id` values.
- `interface`: the interface's name (e.g. "cluster provisioning API").
- `kind` ∈ {`api`, `data-store`, `queue`, `ingress`, `webhook`, `cli`,
  `other`}.
- `exposure` ∈ {`public`, `tenant`, `partner`, `internal`} — `public` is
  reachable without tenant credentials; `internal` is operator/control-plane
  only but carries tenant data.
- `complexity` ∈ {`low`, `medium`, `high`} — how much leverage a malicious
  tenant gets from the input the interface accepts (rating criteria in
  `harnessing/3-audit/isolation-review/SKILL.md`).
- `privilege` / `encryption` / `authentication` / `connectivity` /
  `hygiene`: the five isolation-hardening dimension results, each ∈
  {`yes`, `partial`, `no`, `na`} — the same result vocabulary the
  isolation-review skill scores with (dimension definitions live there;
  a threat model states results, the full review carries the evidence).
- `threat_ids`: comma-separated section 4 ids the boundary's weaknesses
  instantiate (may be empty). This is the join the `/threat-register`
  roll-up uses to attach boundary context to register rows.
- `isolation_review_ref`: empty, or the
  `analysis-results/isolation/<service-slug>/` directory of the full
  `/isolation-review` artifact when one exists.

## Scoring guide

### Impact

| value | means |
|---|---|
| `low` | Nuisance; no data or availability loss. |
| `medium` | Limited data exposure or degraded availability for some users. |
| `high` | Significant data exposure, integrity loss, or full availability loss. |
| `critical` | Full compromise of a primary asset (RCE, auth bypass, data exfil at scale). |
| `existential` | Compromise threatens the organization's continued operation. |

### Likelihood

| value | means |
|---|---|
| `very_rare` | Requires nation-state resources or an unlikely chain of preconditions. |
| `rare` | Requires significant skill and a non-default configuration. |
| `possible` | A motivated attacker with public tooling could plausibly do this. |
| `likely` | The attack surface is reachable and the technique is well known; prior evidence exists in this or similar systems. |
| `almost_certain` | Actively exploited in the wild, or trivially automatable against the default configuration. |

Evidence (past CVEs in the same surface, pentest findings, public exploit
code) moves likelihood **up**. Existing controls move it **down**. Score the
**residual** likelihood after current controls.

## Example (excerpt)

```markdown
## 4. Threats

| id | threat | actor | surface | asset | impact | likelihood | status | controls | evidence | attack_refs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | Memory corruption leading to RCE via untrusted audio file parsing | remote_unauth | dr_wav/dr_flac decoders | host process integrity | critical | likely | unmitigated | none | CVE-2026-29022, CVE-2025-14369 | T1203 |
| T2 | Denial of service via resource exhaustion on decode | remote_unauth | dr_flac decoder | service availability | medium | likely | unmitigated | none | CVE-2025-14369 | T1499 |
| T3 | Supply-chain compromise of vendored single-header dependency | supply_chain | build pipeline | host process integrity | critical | rare | partially_mitigated | pinned commit | | T1195.001 |
```

T1 stays in the model after both CVEs are patched: attackers will still send
malformed audio files. The CVEs are evidence the surface is fertile, not the
threat itself.
