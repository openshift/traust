description: Use when the user asks to mine the disposition ledger for confirmed true positives, build or refresh the rule-calibration corpus, find rule-pack coverage gaps, check per-rule precision, or produce the opengrep rule-authoring backlog — e.g. "mine the ledger", "what TP clusters have no rule", "how precise are the traust rules", "refresh the rule-mining report". Runs out-of-band from audits; audits themselves feed it via structured scanner_correlation entries.

Turn the campaign's disposition ledger into rule-authoring fuel: extract
every ledger-**confirmed** true positive from the cumulative
`*-findings-current.json` reports, cluster by (primary CWE, language),
match against the harness-authored opengrep pack, and aggregate the
per-fact judge decisions audits record in `scanner_correlation` into
campaign-wide per-rule precision.

This skill is the out-of-band half of a loop the audits feed by default:
`/secure-code-audit`'s pre-scan records every promote/dismiss decision as a
structured `scanner_correlation` entry (tool `opengrep`, `rule_id`,
`result: promoted|dismissed`), and this skill harvests them.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` (all optional):

- A findings tree to mine — default `analysis-results/findings` resolved
  from the campaign workspace (or `AUDIT_RESULTS_ROOT`).
- `--pack <dir>` — rule pack to check coverage against (default: the
  in-repo pack `harnessing/3-audit/secure-code-audit/opengrep-rules/`).
- `--out <dir>` — output directory. Default for campaign runs:
  `progress-tracker/metrics/rule-mining/` so the report versions alongside
  the other dashboards.

## Bundled precedent cards

[precedent-cards/pilot.yaml](precedent-cards/pilot.yaml) supplies the pilot
cards used by `tests/test_compile_precedent_cards.py` to check card
validation and compiler behavior. Consult it when maintaining precedent-card
compilation; these fixtures are not findings or production sweep inputs.

## Procedure

**Step 1 — run the deterministic miner** (all analysis is script-side):

```bash
python3 -m traust.cli sweep mine \
  --root analysis-results/findings \
  --out progress-tracker/metrics/rule-mining
```

Outputs: `tp-corpus.jsonl` (one confirmed TP per line — the rule
specification material), `rule-mining.json`, `rule-mining.md`.

> **Optional accelerator — findings-db pre-queries.** Cluster-shape
> questions ("which CWE×language pairs dominate confirmed TPs?", "how
> many resolved-at-fix-commit findings exist for CWE-78?") can be
> answered instantly from the C9 projection (`/findings-db`) before
> committing to a full mine. The miner itself stays file-based — its
> output is rule-authoring material and must reflect the live ledgers,
> not a projection that may be one census behind. DB for scoping,
> miner for the corpus of record.

**Step 2 — interpret the backlog.** For the top uncovered clusters, read
3–5 of the example findings (ids are in the report; fetch their entries
from the source reports) and answer, per cluster: *is this mechanically
detectable?* Clusters like missing-authentication (CWE-306) or confused
deputy (CWE-441) usually are not — say so and move on. For detectable
clusters, propose concrete rule candidates: language, sources/sinks or
pattern shape, expected sanitizers, and the example finding ids that
specify the behavior. That proposal — not rule YAML — is this skill's
deliverable; authoring follows the pack README's standards and its
test-and-calibrate gate.

**Step 3 — review precision.** Precision only counts reports where the
pre-scan actually ran: check `metadata.additional.deterministic_steps`
(`"opengrep": "ran"` vs `"skipped: …"`) before treating an absence of
judge decisions as signal — a skipped scanner is not a quiet rule. Any
rule whose campaign precision (from
audits' judge decisions) sits below the plan's ~50% gate is flagged: read
a sample of its dismissal rationales from the source reports and propose a
tightening (sanitizer, metavariable constraint, benign-suffix exclusion)
or retirement.

**Step 4 — hand back.** Report: TP corpus size, top uncovered clusters
with a detectability verdict each, the per-language coverage table
(confirmed TPs, covered/uncovered clusters, pack rule count — sorted by
uncovered-TP count, the tranche-priority order), rule candidates
proposed, precision flags, and the calibration-worklist size (repos
whose confirmed TPs the pack should rediscover — the re-scan set for
validating pack changes).
Update the rule-pack backlog your deployment keeps when the picture has
changed materially.

## Regression-rule drafts (C6)

Every RESOLVED-at-a-fix-commit ledger finding is a free calibration pair:
pre-fix file (rule must fire) and post-fix file (rule must not). Stage
drafts, author, verify, promote:

```bash
# 1. stage drafts (deterministic; identical pairs skipped)
python3 harnessing/mine-ledger/scripts/emit_rule_drafts.py --results-root ../analysis-results \
    [--cwe CWE-494] [--limit 6]
# 2. author patterns: in the draft's rule.skeleton.yaml so that
python3 harnessing/mine-ledger/scripts/emit_rule_drafts.py \
    --verify harnessing/mine-ledger/rule-drafts/<draft> \
    --rule   harnessing/mine-ledger/rule-drafts/<draft>/rule.skeleton.yaml
# passes (before/ fires, after/ silent)
# 3. promote: move the rule into the pack's matching CATEGORY file
#    (never a regression.yaml dump) with ruleid:/ok: fixture lines,
#    keep the regression_of metadata (fingerprint + fix commit — that is
#    what links a future firing back to the original resolved finding),
#    then delete the draft dir.
```

Not every fix is rule-expressible: additive-coverage fixes (a filter
gained patterns) and cross-file behavioral fixes have no matchable
pre-shape — reject those drafts with a note rather than authoring a
noisy rule. First promoted regression rule:
`traust-bash-regression-codecov-uploader-latest` (bash/supply-chain).

## Class-generalization sweeps (plan §6, Phase 4)

Every **confirmed** finding with a syntactic signature — a sink call
form, a config key+value, an annotation misuse, a hardcoded literal —
defines a class the whole corpus should be checked for. The sweep
engine (python3 -m traust.cli sweep) extends the backlog flow above into
a full loop: **backlog item → draft → calibrate → SWEEP → triage**.
Four resumable stages:

```bash
# 1. gather + classify confirmed findings (ledger validity=confirmed
#    plus the Phase-0 confirmation artifacts: fast-track criticals,
#    matrix stage-2 votes, 0d fresh-only triage); rule-expressible vs
#    not is decided deterministically and every "not" carries a reason
python3 -m traust.cli sweep collect
# 2. stage candidate rules for expressible classes with no harness-pack
#    coverage (dedup against pack rule ids + existing drafts); drafts
#    land in rule-drafts/ per the conventions above, each citing its
#    source confirmed finding(s) in metadata.generalized_from
python3 -m traust.cli sweep draft
# 3. author the pattern (human+LLM, same authoring contract as C6),
#    calibrate via the pack's test-and-calibrate gate, then sweep —
#    shallow clones into a bounded temp root, one rule, --limit capped
python3 -m traust.cli sweep sweep --rule <draft-or-rule-id>
# 4. aggregate hits into the triage-ready candidates file + summary
python3 -m traust.cli sweep emit --rule <draft-or-rule-id>
```

**Run-by-default policy (plan §6):** once a class rule is authored and
calibrated, the corpus-wide sweep RUNS by default — it is not a
proposal to maybe sweep later — and its results ENTER TRIAGE. The
artifact says so in its own header. The engine never files findings,
never routes to Jira, and never adjudicates a hit.

**Human points, unchanged:** (1) pattern authoring against the cited
source findings; (2) rule promotion into the shipped pack, which stays
with the existing mine-ledger calibration path (fixture `ruleid:`/`ok:`
lines, the plan's test-and-calibrate gate — never promoted by the
engine); (3) verdicts on sweep hits, which belong to /triage and its
disposition ledger like any other candidate batch.

Sweep output lands at
`analysis-results/scan-testing/sweeps/<rule-id>/sweep-candidates.json`
(schema: repo, file:line, matched excerpt, rule id, source-finding
provenance) plus a `sweep-summary.md`, and is consumed as /triage input
material. Stage state lives under the sweeps root's `_state/` dir;
every stage skips work already done (re-run to resume).

## Scheduled lane (python3 -m traust.cli sweep rule-lane)

The deterministic half of this skill runs as a standing lane
(docs/continuous-operations.md, "Lane cadences") — orchestrator-neutral in
the dependency-watch pattern: identical behavior from an operator
session, cron, or any enterprise scheduler. One entry point chains the
miner, `sweep_engine.py collect` + `draft`, bounded regression-draft
staging (`emit_rule_drafts.py --skip-existing --limit N` — existing
draft dirs are never clobbered), and a **delta report** against the
previous `rule-mining.json` (new/resolved/changed uncovered clusters,
precision movements crossing the ~50% gate, TP-corpus growth) written to
`progress-tracker/metrics/rule-mining/lane-delta.{json,md}`. Exit 0 =
quiet, 1 = attention needed (the delta says what), 2 = a stage failed.
No model calls happen inside the runner.

**Stage-A gate reachability.** Each pass also answers, per watched
language and candidate pack, *is calibrating this language possible
yet?* — no clones, pure corpus plus the cached pack. A rule clears the
rediscovery gate only by firing in ≥3 repos that share a CWE the pack
targets, so when no covered CWE spans that many the run is unwinnable
before it starts and would return a table of structural zeros. Measured
2026-08-07 against argus-observe-rules: rust/c/csharp max span **1**,
cpp **0** — all blocked on ground truth, not tooling. The lane raises
attention only when a gate **opens**; a steady blocked state is silent,
because a weekly complaint about a known-blocked language is noise.
Watched set: `WATCHED_LANGS` / `WATCHED_PACKS` in the runner.

**Enabled external-pack rules are re-checked against the precision
gate.** An external pack is enabled per-rule via
`$TRAUST_CONFIG_HOME/rule-pack-allowlist.yaml` (`run_opengrep.py --rule-allow @<file>`),
never wholesale — argus ships 640 rules of which 19 are 86% of volume.
Stage A can only measure *rediscovery* before a rule has ever run;
precision arrives afterwards from `scanner_correlation`, so each pass
re-scores every allowlisted rule and flags any that fell below the ~50%
gate as a demotion candidate (one YAML line). Rules not yet judged in
any audit are listed separately — silence is not a pass.

```bash
# weekly (Mondays 06:40), from the campaign workspace root — plus
# on-demand whenever /drift-watch's `rule-mining` row goes stale
# (ledger events >7d newer than the artifact, the post-wave trigger)
40 6 * * 1  cd $WS && python3 -m traust.cli sweep rule-lane
```

**Standing delegation (user, 2026-07-29):** scheduled agent runs of this
skill proceed from the lane's delta report through rule authoring **and
the full test-and-calibrate gate** — fixture `ruleid:`/`ok:` lines
firing/silent, the whole-pack regression suite, TP-rediscovery
calibration against the corpus repos — WITHOUT asking for per-run
approval. The mechanical gate is the promotion criterion: a rule that
passes all three legs is promoted into the pack; one that does not is
not, and no amount of session judgment overrides that in either
direction. Sweep hits and mined candidates still route to **/triage**
like any other candidate batch — the lane never auto-files findings,
never writes to ledgers, and never touches Jira.

## Constraints

- Read-only over the findings tree; never edits reports or ledgers.
- The miner is a candidate generator: cluster counts and precision numbers
  route attention, they do not conclude — rule decisions stay with the
  authoring loop and its mechanical calibration gate (delegated for
  scheduled runs as above).
- Cadence: weekly via the lane runner (python3 -m traust.cli sweep rule-lane,
  see *Scheduled lane*), plus a post-wave trigger — `/drift-watch`'s
  `rule-mining` row goes stale when ledger changes are >7 days newer
  than `rule-mining.json`, so a large audit/triage wave summons the lane
  ahead of schedule.

## Integrations

- **Inputs:** cumulative `*-findings-current.json` ledgers and the
  `scanner_correlation` judge decisions audits record by default.
- **Inputs (sweeps):** any prior confirmation artifacts under
  `analysis-results/scan-testing/` (fast-track critical confirmations,
  matrix votes, fresh-only triage) alongside the ledgers.
- **Outputs:** `rule-mining.{json,md}` inform the opengrep-pack backlog
  (plan doc) and are freshness-gated by `/drift-watch`'s `rule-mining`
  row; `tp-corpus.jsonl` is the rule-authoring specification
  corpus consumed by the pack's test-and-calibrate workflow — a human
  authoring loop, deliberately not another skill; sweep runs
  write `sweep-candidates.json` and `sweep-summary.md` per rule under
  `analysis-results/scan-testing/sweeps/`, consumed by **/triage** as
  raw candidate input (run-by-default policy, error-correction plan §6;
  the ingest mapping — `candidates[]` fields, `origin: sweep`,
  provenance-as-context — is the triage SKILL.md's "Note —
  class-generalization sweep candidates").
- **Outputs (lane):** `lane-delta.{json,md}` (producer:
  python3 -m traust.cli sweep rule-lane) — consumed by the operator /
  scheduled `/mine-ledger` session as the worklist for the delegated
  authoring-and-calibration pass (*Scheduled lane* above), and by
  `/drift-watch`'s `rule-mining` staleness row, which triggers the next
  lane run when ledgers outrun the artifact. The lane's nonzero exit is
  the scheduler-facing attention signal.
