# Explicitly link this clone's skills into ~/.claude/skills for agent
# discovery. Extracted from the pre-commit hook (audit E8, remediation
# plan P1.8): a git hook silently modifying $HOME agent configuration is
# hostile-contributor territory for an open-source repo — linking is now
# an explicit, user-run action.
#
# Repairs as well as creates. A link can be wrong in three ways, and the
# 2026-08-26 stage restructure produced all three at once:
#
#   dangling  the target directory is gone (skill moved under a stage dir)
#   stale     the target directory still exists but holds no SKILL.md —
#             e.g. a leftover working tree at the pre-restructure path
#   correct   points at a directory that really does hold the skill
#
# The previous version guarded with `[ ! -e "$link" ]`. `-e` dereferences,
# so it saw *dangling* as absent and tried `ln -s` over an existing symlink
# (`File exists`, and with `set -e` the whole run aborted on the first one),
# while *stale* dereferenced successfully and was skipped as healthy. It
# could therefore repair neither. Fixed here by testing the link itself
# (`-L`) and validating the target actually holds a SKILL.md.
#
# Never clobbers a real file or directory, and never hijacks a link that
# resolves to a working skill in a different clone — both are reported and
# left alone.
#
# Usage: bin/link_skills.sh [--dry-run] [--prune]
#   --dry-run  report what would change, touch nothing
#   --prune    also remove links into THIS clone whose skill no longer exists
#
# bash 3.2 (macOS system bash) — no associative arrays, no `readlink -f`,
# no `ln -n`/`-h` (BSD and GNU disagree); relink is rm-then-ln.

# Deliberately no `-e`: one unlinkable skill must not abandon the other 57.
